events

- events are user actions like clicks, key presses, or form submissions that trigger a response in your application. React uses a synthetic event system, which provides a cross-browser compatible way to handle events. 

synthetic events in React?

-  synthetic events are a cross-browser wrapper around native browser events, providing a consistent and predictable way to handle events across different browsers.`

What is React ?.
- React (also called React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces â€” especially single-page applications where you need a fast, dynamic experience without reloading the whole page.

It was created by Facebook (now Meta) and is maintained by Meta along with a community of developers.

What are the major features of React?
- The major features of React are:

Uses JSX syntax, a syntax extension of JS that allows developers to write HTML in their JS code.
It uses Virtual DOM instead of Real DOM considering that Real DOM manipulations are expensive.
Supports server-side rendering which is useful for Search Engine Optimizations(SEO).
Follows Unidirectional or one-way data flow or data binding.
Uses reusable/composable UI components to develop the view.

How is JSX transformed into JavaScript? (Understand the role of Babel.)

- JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension used with React that allows you to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript. However, browsers don't understand JSX directly. This is where Babel comes in.

Role of Babel in JSX Transformation
Babel is a JavaScript compiler that transforms JSX into plain JavaScript (specifically, into React.createElement() calls), which browsers can understand.

"Babel is a compiler that transforms code from one language to another. In the case of JSX, it transforms the JSX syntax into equivalent JavaScript code that can be understood by browsers. "
ðŸ“Œ Recommended Practice
If you're working solo, consistency is king. If you're working on a team, follow the project's established style.

ðŸ‘‰ A balanced convention:
    Folders: kebab-case
    Component files: PascalCase
    Utility/hooks/API files: camelCase or kebab-case


What Are React Components?
- React components are the building blocks of any React application. They are reusable, independent pieces of UI that return JSX to describe what should appear on the screen.
